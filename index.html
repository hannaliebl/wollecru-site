        <h2>Farming Healthy Soil</h2>
        <p>Life at Wollecru centers around nurturing 60 acres of land used to raise sheep, trees, vines and flowers so that they
        may flourish in harmony with all the wildness around us.</p>
        <p>The symbiosis between sheep, orchard, vineyard, woods, and pastures produces great food, fertility, medicine, and
        management for one another. Our part in these relationships is to encourage and provide biodiversity, ideal
        partnerships, care and protection. In return we receive wonderful wool to weave into blankets and textiles, sheep skins
        and meats for protein and warmth, fruits for pleasant libations, and flora for beauty, dyes, and sharing. We use these
        products as a means for us to remain stewards of the land and continue to be part of our ecological community.</p>

        <h2>Sheep</h2>
        <p>At Wollecru, sheep graze through pastures, an orchard, a vineyard, and adolescent woodlands. They intensively graze
        through paddocks, moving to fresh forage almost daily. This concentrated feeding benefits the soil, the plants that grow
        in it, and the sheep themselves. With each quick bite of these plants, a bit of root material sheds and deposits carbon
        into the soil. This stimulates new green plant material to grow and absorb more carbon dioxide from the air. Sheep
        manure adds carbon and fertility to the soil which feeds a diverse array of grasses, flowers, herbs, shrubs, and trees
        for the sheep to eat. This varied diet allows the sheep to self-regulate and self-medicate by choosing the which plants
        they need and desire, positively affecting their health and happiness. As their body condition increases so does the
        growth of their marvelous wool.</p>
        <p>The sheep flock is a hybrid of British Long wooled (Romney, Cotswold) and Nordic short tailed (Shetland, Finn). Breeding
        these crosses produces sheep that are hardy, thrive on a grass-based diet, are good mothers, and produce long lustrous
        wool.</p>
        <p>Every fall we harvest a few sheep for meat, which we sell as whole or half animals in butchered cuts. If you are
        interested in hearing about meat availability, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdv43B5ha1PwhrYHb_7UmrQShMWWtVVnwBluqQ_BSanIjZ3FQ/viewform">sign up for our seasonal newsletter</a> where we will announce when we have
        lamb for sale.</p>

        <h2>Wool and Weaving</h2>
        <p>Each spring, a few weeks before lambing, the sheep are shorn. The wool is sorted by color, processed at a nearby fiber
        mill, and returned to us in large cones of yarn for weaving. This yarn is either left as its original colors or dyed
        using plants that grow on and around the farm. These natural dyes result in rich colors that are reminiscent of the
        landscape. By experimenting over the years with natural dyes, we discovered which plants grows well in our area, and
        what colors remain vibrant and colorfast for years. Some signature colors come from Japanese Indigo, wild foraged sheep
        sorrel, onion skins, dyers coreopsis and wild impatiens.</p>
        <p>Once we have a palate of the season’s colors, the yarn is woven in blankets that are both visually stunning and
        utilitarian, wall hangings that reflect the beautiful natural world around us, and other home goods. We also sell a
        limited amount of knitting yarn each season. These products can be found for sale in our <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Wollecru">online store</a> or at local
        markets. Get touch if you would like to work with us to create a custom project.</p>
